# Bad Algorithms Made Worse

This is a collection of college work and small personal projects that should not be taken very seriously.
Consider it a treasure trove of miscellaneous code I've written


In hindsight, naming this repository like this implies these algorithms are *bad*; However that's not actually true.
The *bad* actually refers to me trying the implement these algorithms.
